# Runner Role

Ops has a monitoring platform runner, to ensure that alerts from [CheckMK](https://pulcheck-staging.princeton.edu/pulmonitor) in any of our applications are ticketed and appropriately addressed.

## Norms and Duties

There is one runner per week.  The new runner is selected during the Ops Meeting, which occurs every week on Thursday.

The runner's duties are as follows:

Each workday check:

* Create a ticket for each new alert encountered, if one does not already exist.
  * The alerts are either in the "sensu-alerts" channel and as email messages
* Bring alert tickets to the individual and/or the team's attention.
