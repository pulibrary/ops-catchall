## Rails Bridge

All the documentation here is inspired from [Rails Bridge](https://docs.railsbridge.org/) which and localized here. You should already have [Rails](rails_app.md) installed. One key difference is that our curriculumm will not be using we will be using your sandbox instead.

### Installfest

Here's a list of tools you'll be installing. As you go through the workshop, we'll explain what each one is for and how to use it.

* Ruby. A programming language.
* Rails. A framework for making web applications with Ruby. It does a lot of the setting up work for you, which is really handy, but we'll cover this in more detail a little later.
* Git. A revision or source control system. It creates a repository (sometimes called a repo for short), which is a complete history of your changes to what you're working on. This means you can undo changes and roll back to previous versions of your work if something has gone wrong.
* GitHub. A place to store your Git repository online, so you can access it from any computer.
* Capistrano. A remote server automation and deployment tool written in Ruby.
* Your sandbox. An application server, which hosts your application while you're working on it. This allows you to access your app online and interact with it from any browser, instead of just on your local computer.
* VSCode (or [some other editor](https://github.com/pulibrary/command_line_curriculum/tree/main/sec3)). To write programs in Ruby, you need a text editor to create, edit and save Ruby files.
* A couple of useful Ruby gems. Ruby gems are useful bits of Ruby code that someone has created for reuse, so you don't have to write it yourself.

Create a directory for the rails bridge curriculum

```zsh
mkdir -p ~/Documents/railsbridge
```

Then let's setup your [macOS](macos.md)
