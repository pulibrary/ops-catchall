KVM Installation | What is it?

A keyboard-video-monitor switch is a device that allows control over multiple computers via a single keyboard, monitor, and mouse using a single “switch” mechanism to give control over to the device you have selected. 

A KVM machine is used to switch seamlessly between multiple connections without having to use multiple cords to choose what will be your main display.

A KVM device consists of LED indicators signaling what device currently holds control of what is displaying. The device includes several ports (USB, HDMI, Input/Output, Keyboard and Mouse ports). 

These ports allow the user to set up and display dual-monitors along with a PC, or other external hardware (that has compatible connectivity). For my setup I am using the KVM device to be able to switch devices directly between my PC (Macbook) and my Linux-Meerkat (Mini Desktop - Ubuntu 22.04), all with the simple act of choosing and switching to my desired output.
