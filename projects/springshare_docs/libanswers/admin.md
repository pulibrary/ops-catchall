## LibAnswers Admin

There are several tasks in LibAnswers that admins need to perform, including creating user accounts and creating queues. 

### User accounts

To create a new account: 

1. In the ```Admin``` drop-down, choose ```Accounts.```
2. Here, you can click the tab to ```Create a New Account``` and look up a user by NetID email to see if they have an existing Springshare account that can be imported. If not, create a new account for them using their NetID email. 
3. On the Manage Accounts page, you will see the list of existing accounts and can edit a user's account by clicking the pencil/paper icon in the ```Actions``` column on the right. 
4. The Manage Accounts page has other useful information, including a user's level (regular, admin, etc.) in LibAnswers, the Default Dataset they see upon login, and whether their LibChat account is active (see more in the chat.md doc). 

### System Settings

To manage overall system settings: 

1. In the ```Admin``` drop-down, choose ```System Settings.``` The ```General``` tab is where overall system information can be edited. 
2.  In the ```Access Rules``` tab, there is a section at the bottom called ```Block List for Email, SMS, and LibChat.``` This is where we can add entries (up to 100) of users who have violated the rules of our system and should be banned from submitting tickets or chats. 
3. In the ```Look & Feel``` tab, we have custom header, footer and CSS/JS code that comes from our [Lux Design System](https://github.com/pulibrary/lux-design-system).  You can work with the DACS team to edit or update this code.

### Metadata

The Metadata section in the Admin panel is where tags can be created/managed for each queue (see queues.md to learn more about tags).

### Widgets & API 

This section in the admin panel lets us see all widgets we use across the library to manage the places on our website where patrons can submit a ticket or chat. The ```API Authentication``` tab contains information about our authentication points as well as where we can add applications to connect via LibAnswers's API.
