## LibChat

The library uses LibChat to chat in real-time with users. There are a few areas where Chat is managed: 

### LibChat Access

Users must be given Chat access when their account is created. To do this: 

1. From the ```Admin``` drop-down, choose ```Accounts.```
2. If the user does not yet have an account, choose the ```Create a New Account``` tab at the top to either create a new one from scratch (using their NetID email) or import an account from another LibApp. 
3. After you enter their email address and fill in general information, go to the ```LibChat Access``` tab and choose the radio button to make them an ```Active``` user. (Note, not everyone needs access to LibChat, so many users will leave this setting ```Inactive```.)

### LibChat Settings

To manage overall settings for LibChat: 

1. From the ```Admin``` drop-down, choose ```LibChat Set-up.```
2. The ```Departments``` tab will list which departments currently use LibChat as well as who the assigned users or queues are. 
3. To add users to a department, click the person icon in the ```Actions``` column. 
4. To add a department, click the ```Add New Department``` button at the top. To edit an existing department, click the pencil/paper icon in the ```Actions``` column to the right of the department. 

Other LibChat settings to manage include: 

1. In the ```Banned IP List``` we can add the IP address of users who we would like to ban from the system for inappropriate use of LibChat. 
2. In the ```System Canned Messages``` tab, you can create and reorder common messages to send to patrons with the click of a button within LibChat. 
3. In the ```Who's Online``` tab, you can see which staff member is staffing Chat (and you can terminate their session from here), which departments are online, and any patrons who are chatting. 
4. In the ```Settings``` tab, you can control overall elements, such as transcript settings and sign-off schedule rules. 
5. The ```Screenshaing APIs``` tab allows us to manage our screensharing option (we use the Zoom option) and whose accounts are configured to use that option (note: Zoom integrations at the user-level are managed in LibCal).
6. The ```Jump to Chat Widgets``` tab manages the different widgets we have embedded on the Library website for users to connect to chat; these widgets can be edited or we can create new widgets here. 

### Other LibChat Features

Other LibChat features can be managed by Admins and Regular users with LibChat access via the ```LibChat``` drop-down in the LibAnswers top menu. 

1. In the ```LibChat``` drop-down, there is a section called ```Chat Management``` where you can also manage widets, the chat Question Bank, and Canned Messages. 
2. In the ```Chat Reports``` section of the ```LibChat``` drop-down, the following can be managed (see more details via Springshare [documentation](https://ask.springshare.com/libanswers/search?t=0&g=3&topics=LibChat&adv=1)):
