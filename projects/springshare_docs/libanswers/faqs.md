## FAQs

FAQs in LibAnswers are groups of questions that get asked frequently enough via tickets or chats that we've created a knowledge base to keep answers updated and available to users to broswe through on our site before/in addition to submitting a question. 

### FAQ Groups

FAQs are divided into groups, usually by subject or location. To manage FAQ groups: 

1. From the ```Admin``` drop-down, choose ```FAQ Groups.```
2. From the Manage FAQ Groups page, you'll see our current FAQ groups, their friendly URL, how many questions are in each group, and the access level, either public/open, internal, or restricted internal. 
3. You can edit an FAQ group by clicking the pencil/paper icon in the ```Actions``` column on the right.
4. You can preview how a group looks to patrons by clicking the eyeball icon in the ```Actions``` column on the right. 

### FAQ Knowledge Base

Regular users in LibAnswers can view and filter the FAQ Knowledge base: 

1. In the top-level LibAnswers navigation, click the drop-down for ```Tickets & FAQs``` and choose ```FAQ Knowledge Base.```
2. In the Knowledge Base, you can view, edit, and filter FAQs by question, keyword, group, topic, etc.
