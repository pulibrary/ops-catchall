## Queues

We use LibAnswers at PUL for the email queues it allows various people around the library to manage. For many queues, we have a ```@princeton.edu``` email address or service account that forwards into a queue; the queue email addresses themselves must end with ```@princeton.libanswers.com``` but can be customized before the ```@``` symbol. Admins in Springshare have access to view/edit all queues. Regular users must be added at the queue-level to any queues they need access to and can be given limited or full access. 

We currently pay Springshare to license 15 queues. If we need more queues, we can purchase them in groups of 3 from Springshare by emailing sales@springshare.com. The following are administrative tasks frequently performed around queues. 

### Queue administration

#### Managing Queues

Queues in LibAnswers can be managed via the Admin tab on the LibAnswers landing page. 

1. From the ```Admin``` drop-down, choose ```Queues.```
2. On the Queues admin page, you will see a list of all queues in use, their email address, as well as how many tickets are in that queue (tickets have statuses of new, open, pending, or closed; unless you delete them, closed tickets remain in a queue). 
3. To edit a queue, click the pencil/paper icon in the ```Actions``` column to the right. 
4. When editing a queue, there are various options to customize the following: 
- In the ```User Access``` tab, you can add people who have LibAnswers accounts to be Regular or Admin users, or users that are "limited" and can only add internal notes in tickets. 
- The ```Question Form``` tab allows you to customize the form that patrons fill out to submit a ticket to the queue. 
- The ```Email``` tab lets you edit the receiving email address of the queue, add any email addresses that are being forwarded into the queue (e.g. ```@princeton.edu``` addresses), and edit options for how the email gets set from the queue (all of our queues use the default that Springshare sends the emails).
- The ```Email Templates``` tab lets you customize details about template emails that get sent 
when certain actions are completed in the queue (e.g. transferring a ticket to another user, patron reply notification, etc.).
- The ```Notifications``` tab defines which staff get notified directly to their own email any time a ticket is submitted to the queue. 
5. Learn more about customizing a queue's settings and question form from Springshare [documentation](https://ask.springshare.com/springboards/faq/1887#settings) (note: you must be signed into your LibApps account to view documentation)

#### Creating a New Queue

2. Click the ```+ Add another queue``` button at the top of the dashboard. 
3. Give the queue a name and click the ```Save``` button. 
4. Your queue will be listed at the bottom of the queues list, and you can edit all of the features listed in Queue Management above by clicking on the pencil/paper icon in the ```Actions``` column.
