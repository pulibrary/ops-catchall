## RefAnalytics

The RefAnalytics section of LibAnswers lets us keep statistics about who is using our ticketing and chat services and the kinds of questions that get asked frequently. Most admin tasks for RefAnalytics involve giving people permissions to access a queue's RefAnalytics, turning RefAnayltics on for a queue dataset (which is done at the queue settings level; see queues.md), or editing the fields/values contained in a dataset. 

### Managing Datasets 

RefAnalytics uses datasets that either connect to a queue or are stand-alone that are helpful for a particular department (e.g. at PUL, many use datasets to track circulation or access desk statistics). There is a user-level in LibAnswers called "RefAnalytics only" that is helpful to give those who are only accessing a dataset and do not need access to other areas of LibAnswers (e.g. student employees who staff service desks is a common example). Learn more about how to manage datasets in Springshare's [documentation](https://ask.springshare.com/libanswers/search?t=0&g=3&topics=LibChat&adv=1). 

To manage datasets: 

1. In the ```Admin``` drop-down, choose the ```Ref. Analytics``` option. 
2. On the Reference Analytics Settings dashboard, you'll be able to see the various datasets, their color-coding, number of transactions, and you can edit them by choosing the paper/pencil icon in the ```Actions``` column on the right. 
3. When editing a dataset, you can click the ```Set Up``` tab to edit basic information, such as the name and color of the set. You can also add/edit the fields for this dataset, which is a common task that admins get asked to do. 
4. In the ```Metadata Fields``` section of the ```Set Up``` tab, use labels to categorize the type of questions you'd like to track. Use ```Add/Edit Responses``` to add values to the field that you'd like staff to have the option of checking off when they are recording a transaction. 
5. You can add users to a dataset by clicking on the ```User Access``` tab of the Reference Analytics Settings dashboard. There are various access levels users can have to datasets, which are detailed in Springshare's [documentation](https://ask.springshare.com/libanswers/faq/3357). At an individual user's account level, you can choose which dataset should be their default, if they need one. 

### Adding Transactions and Viewing Statistics 

There are a couple of ways to add transactions to a RefAnalyics dataset:

1. The first is through a queue that has RefAnalytics enabled (there will be a set of required questions at the bottom that staff can fill out before submitting a ticket resposne). 
2. Regular and RefAnalytics-only users who have access to RefAnalytics can add a transaction by clicking the drop-down for Ref. Analytics in the main LibAnswers navigation menu and choosing ```Add Transaction``` (note: users should make sure they are adding a transaction to the correct dataset; this is where setting default datasets at the user-level comes in handy).
3. Regular and RefAnalytics-only users also have the options from the RefAnalytics drop-down to view/edit transactions, view statistics for a given time frame with a number of filtering options, and running various reports.
