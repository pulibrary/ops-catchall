## LibGuides Groups

Groups are part of the LibGuides infrastructure and are different from Subjects, (see [subjects.md](link)). Guides can only belong to one Group and users can have access to certain Groups in which they can edit guides. Each Group has a homepage that can be modified in the ```Look & Feel``` section of the Guides ```Admin``` drop-down. Group homepages list a Group's guides and owners (see [PUL Art & Archaeology example](https://libguides.princeton.edu/art-archaeology-guides)). 

### Manage Groups

To manage which Guides belong to Groups and to manage Group settings: 

1. Navigate to the ```Admin``` drop-down and select Groups.
2. Under the ```Actions``` column, choose the edit icon. 
3. You can use the tabs at the top of the Group to perform tasks such as setting/editing a Friendly URL, adding/removing user access, and editing the Look & Feel of the Group Homepage (see [Springshare's documentation](https://ask.springshare.com/libguides/faq/937) on editing a Group Homepage)(you must be logged into your PUL LibApps account to view).

### Add Guide to a Group
