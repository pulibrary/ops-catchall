## LibGuides Subjects

Subjects are part of the LibGuides infrastructure and are different from Groups (see [groups.md](link)). Guides can belong to multiple subjects, and any LibGuides regular user can add a Subject to any Guide they can edit (see [Confluence documentation](https://pul-confluence.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SS/pages/1769535/Adding+Subjects+to+Your+Guides)). Subjects are also connected to Experts and Databases (Assets); a Subject's landing page shows all affiliated Subject metadata (see [PUL African American Studies example](https://libguides.princeton.edu/african-american-studies)).

### Manage Subjects

3. To edit a Subject's Guides or Experts, click the edit icon in the ```Actions``` column for any Subject. 
4. In the ```Guides``` tab, select any Guide to join the Subject. 
5. In the ```Experts``` tab, select user accounts (note: multiple users can be listed as Experts).
