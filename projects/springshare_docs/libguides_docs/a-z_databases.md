## A-Z Database List 

Our LibGuides CMS (Content Management System) is where the library's main list of [Databases](https://libguides.princeton.edu/az/databases) is managed and maintained. For the most part, Electronic Resources Librarians and selectors in the DMG (Database Management Group) add and maintain entries on the admin side of the A-Z List within LibGuides. However, there are times a Springshare admin needs to help. Some common tasks are included below. 

### Pages Look & Feel 

As of June 2024, PUL is using the updated A-Z Databases interface that is still in Beta mode within LibGuides. One admin task is updating the overall look and feel of the public A-Z homepage, which uses Bootstrap 5. To access this: 

1. From the ```Content``` tab in LibGuides, choose from the drop-down ```A-Z List Management Beta.```  
2. In the left side navigation, choose ```System Settings``` and select ```Pages Look & Feel.```
3. In the ```Content Customizations``` tab, we have selected defaults for our site that should not be changed in general unless other website/branding changes are being made. 
4. In the ```Header & Footer``` tab, we are using the [Lux Design System](https://github.com/pulibrary/lux-design-system), similar to the header/footer for the rest of LibGuides system. You can work with the DACS team if this HTML code needs to be updated. 
5. In the ```Custom JS/CSS``` tab, you will see that the Customization Files used in the rest of the LibGuides system are also used here. In the ```Custom CSS``` and ```Custom JS``` tabs, we are using the same LUX code as in the rest of the Guides system. You can work with the DACS team if this JS/CSS code needs to be updated. Note that in the Custom JS code, we are also including Copyright and Access text here, in addition to in the Content Module on the main A-Z landing page (see section below) so that it is included on each individual landing page because, at this time (2024), there are not modifiable templates for individual landing pages. 

### A-Z List Homepage Content

The content that appears on the main A-Z List homepage is managed in another area of the admin portal. To access that: 

1. From the ```Content``` tab in LibGuides, choose from the drop-down ```A-Z List Management Beta.```  
2. In the left side navigation, choose ```A-Z Databases``` and expand the ```Settings``` section and choose ```Public A-Z Page.``` 
3. You will see in the blue box at the top, we have toggled on the New Public A-Z Page (as of June 2024). If for any reason we need to revert back to the old version of the A-Z List, this button can be toggled off. 
4. In the ```Main Content``` section, there are options to change the title and intro text of our main A-Z List landing page as well as show what content appears on the main page. 
5. There is a ```Use Database Landing Pages``` setting that we have ```toggled ON (for all databases),``` meaning that each database entry gets its own landing page (see more in the section below). This can be either toggled off, or customized at a per-database level. 
6. In the ```Sidebar``` section, you can choose on which side the sidebar appears on the main pages and what content boxes to include in the sidebar. At PUL, we have included a Custom Content Module from a LibGuide where we keep copyright and access text current (the Content Module is called ```(Content Box) Copyright and Access```). 
    - To update the text of that content box, you will need to go back to the LibGuides dashboard and search for the Guide called ```Content Reused Elsewhere``` (note that this is an unpublished Guide). 
    - You will see the Get Help and Copyright and Access boxes are contained in that Guide, and any edits made to those boxes will be reflected in the Content Module on the main A-Z List landing page. 

### Individual Database Landing Pages

Each database entry has an individual landing page with a button to access the database, a description, our Copyright and Access statement, and any other specific information that selectors would like to provide. To edit these: 

1. From the ```Content``` tab in LibGuides, choose from the drop-down ```A-Z List Management Beta.```  
2. In the left side navigation, choose ```A-Z Databases``` and choose ```Main Database List.```
3. Use the right sidebar to search for the Database you want to modify. When you find it, click the three stacked dots on the right-hand side and choose ```Edit Item.``` You will then be able to customize what information appears on the individual landing page for that database. 
4. Note that you can specify associated Subjects and Best Bets in this editor. Subjects are pulled in from the overall Subjects in the LibGuides system. Best Bets are maintained by the web content editors, since they are linked to the library's All Search application (see [Confluence documentation](https://pul-confluence.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/IT/pages/104300604/All-Search+Best+Bets)).
