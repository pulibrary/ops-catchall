## Change LibGuide Owner

Each LibGuide can have one owner, but guides can have multiple editors. A common admin task involves changing a guide's owner when a staff member leaves or changes responsibilities. To do that, follow these steps: 

1. Navigate to the ```Content``` tab in the top dashboard and click ```Guides``` from the drop-down. 

2. Search for guide by any identifier you have (e.g. name, type, owner).

3. When you find the guide you're looking for, click the person icon on the right to ```Change Guide Owner```.

4. Select new guide owner from the list by starting to type their name.

5. Optionally, you can check the box to reassign individual assets to the new owner (confirm with whomever is making the request for the new owner).

6. Hit the blue ```Save``` button and changes will be made.
