## LibGuides and Canvas LTI 

LibGuides integrate with Canvas, Princeton's learning management system, through an LTI (Learning Tools Interoperability). Guide owners can link their own guides to Canvas using instructions on [Confluence](https://pul-confluence.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SS/pages/1769500/LibGuides+Canvas) without having admin priviledges. Nevertheless, sometimes the incorrect guide gets linked or the connection doesn't work, and we have to troubleshoot. To do that: 

1. Open the Guide you are trying to add to Canvas in editing mode.

2. From the top right navigation bar, choose the gear icon drop-down and select ```Guide Metadata.```

3. Choose the ```Custom``` Metadata tab and in the ```Name``` column, click the link that says ```Empty.```

4. Here, you will need to add the full course code that the Guide is linking to in Canvas (see the [Confluence documentation](https://pul-confluence.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SS/pages/1769500/LibGuides+Canvas) on how to find and format course codes).

5. Sometimes, you will need to access Canvas to search for courses and/or make sure the Guide is linking to the course correctly. The McGraw Center for Teaching and Learning manages Canvas, and you can [contact](https://mcgraw.princeton.edu/lms) their staff for access.
