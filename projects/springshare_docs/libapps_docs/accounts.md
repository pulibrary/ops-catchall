## LibApps 

LibApps is the overall Springshare app where you can view peoples' site profiles and which apps people have access to. However, you cannot grant access to the various apps within the LibApps module; access must be granted at the individual app level (e.g. LibCal, LibGuides, etc.).

### Accounts: Site Counts and Access

In the Accounts section, you can see which of the LibApps users have access to and you can manage their overall Springshare accounts. To do that: 

1. In the ```Admin``` drop-down, choose ```Manage Accounts.```
2. In the ```Site Count``` column, click on the number to see which of the LibApps that user has access to. (Note: to give them access to an app they don't yet have, you will need to go into that app and provide access; you cannot do it from here.)
3. The ```Last Login``` column will show you their last login date. 
4. In the ```Actions``` column, click on the gear icon to moify a user's account. 
- Do not change the username/email and password fields, as users should sign in using CAS with their Princeton credentials. 
- Here, you can change their overall LibApps account level to Regular or Admin (to change their account level in other apps, you will need to go into the accounts section of the individual apps to do this).
- If you click on the ```Profile Box``` tab at the top, this will let you edit a user's title, pronouns, photo, contact info, personal widgets, and other information. This is the profile box that appears throughout LibApps in Guides, Cal, etc. 
- The Profile Page tab will let you edit whether a user's profile page is enabled and how it appears on the overall Guides [profiles site](https://libguides.princeton.edu/prf.php). (Note: We don't really use this site and it's difficult for people to find; rather, we refer people to the [Subject Specialist page](https://library.princeton.edu/about/staff-directory?area_of_study=All&expertise=1606) using the PUL staff directory.)

### Image Manager

The other helpful tool controlled through the main LibApps section is the Image Manager. 

1. In the top menu of LibApps, click on the ```Image Manager``` tab. 
2. Here, you can manage your Personal Library as well as the Shared Library, which is images that folks using any of the LibApps have decided to add for group use. 
3. In either the Personal or Shared Library, you can create folders for image organizations using the ```Create``` button on the left side ```Folders``` nagivation. 
4. You can also upload a new image using the blue ```Upload New Image``` button at the top of the Personal and Shared Library. 
5. Note that when you add images in any of the LibApps (Cal, Guides, Wizard), they get added to the Image Manager for later use.
