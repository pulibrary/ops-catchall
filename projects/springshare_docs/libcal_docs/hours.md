## LibCal Hours

PUL uses the Hours module to set building hours across all libraries. Only admins have Hours access, but regular users can be given access to Hours (and specific locations within the module). By default, each library should have a staff member dedicated to updating/maintaining their own hours, but admins are often called upon for help with global changes or training staff members on how to use the Hours module. Hours are managed by Templates, which can be applied across multiple locations. Changes to Template hours can be set by adding an Exception on a date-by-date basis (e.g., holidays, early closings, etc.).

### Hours Administration

#### Manage Hours for Library Locations 

1. From the ```Admin``` drop-down, choose ```Hours.``` Here, you will see a preview of all PUL library hours as well as settings for individual libraries and departments within those libraries. 
2. To edit a library's hours, scroll down past the ```Hours Preview``` to the invidivudal location, listed alphabetically. 
3. Choose ```Edit Hours / Exceptions``` for the library or department within the library you want to update. 
4. Under ```Opening Hours``` on the left, you can edit any existing Hours template by choosing the pencil/paper icon in the ```Action``` column. To add a date range and an existing template for that range, choose ```+Add Date Range``` at the bottom of the ```Opening Hours``` section. 
5. An exception to the Opening Hours can be added in the ```Exceptions``` panel on the right by clicking ```+Add Exception``` at the bottom of the panel. An exception can be deleted by clicking the trashcan icon in the ```Action``` column on the right. 

#### Add Users to Hours module 

Users can be added to the Hours module by editing their account: 

1. From the ```Admin``` drop-down, choose ```Accounts.```
2. Click the pencil/paper icon in the ```Action``` column on the right for the person whose account you'd like to edit. 
3. Once in the account, click the ```Permissions``` tab at the top. Scroll to ```Hours``` at the bottom of the page. 
4. Under ```Libraries``` choose the default "Allowed to adjust schedule and add/remove exceptions" to set access on a per library basis. If Full Access to Hours is needed, choose that option from the drop-down. 
5. Under ```Weekly Templates``` choose the default of "Full Access."  
6. In the ```Spaces & Equipment``` section of the page, which is right above the ```Hours``` section, under ```Hours Maintenance,``` choose the default of "Full Access" here as well.  

### Manage Templates

We use the weekly templates feature in LibCal to manage regular hours and schedules for each library. A location can have multiple templates for different time periods (e.g. fall semester, winter break, etc.) and templates can be copied and renamed for ease of use. 

#### Access Templates 

1. From the ```Admin``` drop-down, choose ```Hours.```
2. Choose the ```Weekly Templates``` tab in the top menu. 
3. Here, you can view all existing templates and an hours preview, as well as edit any template by clicking the paper/pencil icon in the ```Action``` column. 
4. Add a new weekly template or copy an existing one by using the buttons above the Weekly Template names/previews. 

#### Apply Templates

To apply a template, you will need to do so in the specific Library location: 

1. From the ```Admin``` drop-down, choose ```Hours.```
2. Choose the ```Libraries``` tab in the top menu.
3. Scroll down past the ```Hours Preview``` and find the location you'd like to edit. In the ```Update``` column, click ```Edit Hours / Exceptions.```
4. To add a new template, choose ```+Add Date Range``` at the bottom of the ```Opening Hours``` panel on the right. 
5. To edit an existing template, choose the pencil/paper icon in the ```Action``` column of the ```Opening Hours``` table. 

### Manage Exceptions

We use exceptions to make changes to site-wide or individual location templates. To do that: 

#### Site-Wide Exceptions

We use site-wide exceptions to apply different hours to all locations for things like holidays or break times. 

1. From the ```Admin``` drop-down, choose ```Hours.```
2. Choose the ```Manage Exceptions``` tab in the top menu.
3. From the calendar on the left, choose the date where you would like to make an exception. 
4. Click on the ```Add Exception``` button underneath the date and then customize the exeception by choosing the type, the locations it applies to, and any custom message. 
5. Click the blue ```Add / Update``` Exceptions button at the bottom to save. 

#### Update Exceptions

Exceptions, such as change of hours or closures, can also be made to an individual location: 

1. From the ```Admin``` drop-down, choose ```Hours.```
2. Choose the ```Libraries``` tab in the top menu.
3. Scroll down past the ```Hours Preview``` and find the location you'd like to edit. In the ```Update``` column, click ```Edit Hours / Exceptions.```
4. The Exceptions are listed in the table on the right. To delete an exception, click the trashcan icon in the ```Action``` column. 
5. To add an exception, click ```+Add Exception``` at the bottom left of the exceptions table.
