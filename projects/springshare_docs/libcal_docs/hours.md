## LibCal Hours

PUL uses the Hours module to set building hours across all libraries. Only admins have Hours access, but regular users can be given access to Hours (and specific locations within the module). By default, each library should have a staff member dedicated to updating/maintaining their own hours, but admins are often called upon for help with global changes or training staff members on how to use the Hours module. Hours are managed by Templates, which can be applied across multiple locations. Changes to Template hours can be set by adding an Exception on a date-by-date basis (e.g., holidays, early closings, etc.).

### Hours Administration

To manage Hours for all library locations: 

1. From the ```Admin``` drop-down, choose ```Hours.``` Here, you will see a preview of all PUL library hours as well as settings for individual libraries and departments within those libraries. 
2. To edit a library's hours, scroll down past the ```Hours Preview``` to the invidivudal location, listed alphabetically. 
3. Choose ```Edit Hours / Exceptions``` for the library or department within the library you want to update. 
4. Under ```Opening Hours``` on the left, you can edit any existing Hours template by choosing the pencil/paper icon in the ```Action``` column. To add a date range and an existing template for that range, choose ```+Add Date Range``` at the bottom of the ```Opening Hours``` section. 
5. An exception to the Opening Hours can be added in the ```Exceptions``` panel on the right by clicking ```+Add Exception``` at the bottom of the panel. An exception can be deleted by clicking the trashcan icon in the ```Action``` column on the right.
