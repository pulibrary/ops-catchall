## LibCal Tickets & Passes

At PUL, we use the Tickets & Passes module to manage outside visitor access to Firestone Library. Users can reserve timeslots from the [Passes page](https://libcal.princeton.edu/passes), and they receive a digital pass after submitting their booking. By default, all Regular LibCal users have access to the ```Tickets & Passes``` tab in the LibCal top menu and can manage reservations. 

### Manage Instiutions

Instiutions are the location-organizing unit for Tickets & Passes, much like Locations in Spaces & Equipment. To manage Institutions: 

1. From the ```Admin``` drop-down, choose ```Tickets & Passes.```
2. Tickets & Passes are organized by Institution. You can manage an existing Institution's settings by clicking the gear icon in the upper right of the Institution's name. You can click the blue button to ```Add New Institution.```
3. For an existing Insitution, you can manage instances of digital or physical passes, such as name, limits, and date validity, by clicking the pencil/paper icon in the ```Action``` column to the right of the pass name. 

### Manage System-Wide Settings 

In addition to Institutions, Admins can manage system-wide settings:  

1. Booking Forms: Booking Forms can be managed from the ```Booking Forms``` tab at the top of the Tickets & Passes section. Note that these Booking Forms are separate from the shared forms in the Spaces & Equipment module. 
2. LibAuth: LibAuth determines whether users log in to make bookings. LibAuth can be turned on/off from the ```LibAuth``` tab in the Tickets & Passes section.  
3. Booking Restrictions: This setting allows admins to set limitations on how often users can book a pass (per day/week/month).
4. Settings: Overall look & feel settings, mostly color palettes for the booking calendar.
