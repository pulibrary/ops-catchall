## LibCal Spaces

LibCal Spaces consist of top-level categories, called Locations. Within Locations are Spaces (individual rooms), Zones (physical groups of Spaces), and Equipment, which are reservable items tied to Locations. 

### Manage Locations 

Admins can manage high-level Location policies that include Hours, Spaces, Zones, and Equipment by selecting the ```Admin``` drop-down and then ```Spaces & Equipment.``` Once in this dashboard, the ```Locations``` tab will show an overview of all Locations and affiliated parts of the system. Admins can also view how many items in our subscription level we have used on this page. System-wide Locations settings can be managed here: 

1. Locations: Locations can be added or edited, by clicking the blue button to ```Add New Location``` or by choosing the pencil/paper icon in the  ```Action``` column of an existing Location. If a Location has Spaces or Equipment affiliated with it, the public pages for them can be viewed by using the icons in the ```Action``` column. 
2. Hours: In addition to managing Hours from the ```Hours``` section in the ```Admin``` drop-down, they can also be managed by Location in the ```Hours``` column of the Locations table and by choosing the ```Hours Templates``` tab in the top menu of the Locations section. 
3. Booking Forms: System-wide Booking Forms can be managed from the ```Booking Forms``` tab at the top of the Locations section. Note that questions need to be added to the Question Bank before they can be added to a Booking Form. Read more about Booking forms for Spaces and Equipment in [LibCal's documentation](https://ask.springshare.com/libcal/faq/1334).
4. LibAuth: LibAuth determines whether users log in to make bookings. LibAuth is set at the Location level in our LibCal and can be managed through the ```LibAuth``` tab at the top of the Locations section. 
5. Settings: Overall settings, such as display settings of the availability grid, mediation emails, and user banning can be accessed in the ```Settings``` tab of the Locations setting.  
6. Search Filters: Search filters can be managed/added from the ```Search Filters``` tab. These can be applied to Spaces so that patrons can search by available resources in a Space, such as power outlets, accessile seating, etc. 
7. Banner Users: Occasionally, we need to ban users from booking Spaces if they have broken our booking rules or policies. From the ```Banned Users``` tab, you can add a user's email address and reason for banning (these can be removed at any time).

### Mangage Spaces

Regular users in LibCal can choose the ```Spaces``` tab in the main LibCal top menu to sort by Location and then Spaces to manage aspects of existing Spaces in the system, such as booking availability, booking confirmations, Space widgets, and exporting booking data (see [LibCal Spaces documentation](https://ask.springshare.com/libcal/search/?t=0) for individual topics). 

1. Admins can manage Spaces from the ```Admin``` drop-down menu, selecting  ```Spaces & Equipment.```
2. From the dashboard, use the ```Spaces``` column of the table to select the Spaces within the Location you would like to manage.  
3. When you click on a Location's Spaces, you will see that Spaces are organized into Categories that have shared settings. Click on the gear icon to the right of a Category's name and choose ```Edit category``` to view/edit its settings. Category-level settings include shared hourly booking limits, access level, description, friendly URL, email templates, LibAuth login rules, and booking mediation rules. 
4. To add a new Category, choose the blue button to ```Add New Category``` from the Location's ```Spaces & Categories``` tab. 
5. To edit an individual Space within a Category, choose the pencil/paper icon in the ```Action``` column on the right of Space grid. 
6. To add an individual Space within a Category, choose the blue button to ```Add New Space``` at the top. Be sure to choose the correct Category from the drop-down in the dialog box (and Zone, if applicable).

### Manage Zones 

Zones provide an optional organizing layer for Spaces in the same physical area within a Location. To manage Zones: 

1. From the ```Admin``` drop-down menu, selecting  ```Spaces & Equipment.```
2. From the dashboard, use the ```Zones``` column of the table to select the Zones within the Location you would like to manage.
3. Click on the gear icon to the right of a Category's name and choose ```Edit Zone``` to view/edit its settings. Zone-level settings share a name, description, and which spaces are part of them. 
4. To add a new Zone, choose the blue button to ```Add Zone``` from the Location's ```Zones``` tab. 
4. To edit an individual Space within a Zone, choose the pencil/paper icon in the ```Action``` column on the right of Zone grid.

### Manage Equipment 

Regular users in LibCal can choose the ```Equipment``` tab in the main LibCal top menu to sort by Location to see the Booking Grid & Availability, check in and check out items, and manage overdue items (see [LibCal Equipment documentation](https://ask.springshare.com/libcal/search/?t=0&g=4&topics=Spaces&adv=1) for individual topics).

Click on the gear icon to the right of a Category's name and choose ```Edit category``` to view/edit its settings. Category-level settings include shared booking limits, access level, description, friendly URL, email templates, LibAuth login rules, and booking mediation rules.

7. To add an individual Item within a Category, choose the blue button to ```Add New Item``` at the top. Be sure to choose the correct Category from the drop-down in the dialog box.
