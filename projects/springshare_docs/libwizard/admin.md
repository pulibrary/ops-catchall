## LibWizard

LibWizard is Springshare's platform for creating forms, tutorials, quizzes, and surveys. It integrates with other LibApps in that you can embed many LibWizard elements into LibGuides, add a survey to a LibCal event, etc. The following admin tasks can be helpful to know: 

### Accounts

To manage accounts: 

1. In the ```Admin``` drop-down, choose ```Accounts.```
2. Here, you can use the blue buttons at the top to ```Add New Account``` or ```Import LibApps Accounts``` that already exist in the system.
3. To change a user's access level, click on the pencil/paper icon in the ```Actions``` column on the right to make them a Regular user, Admin, or to make their account Inactive, which means that their account and all affiliated items in LibWizard remain in tact, but LibWizard will not appear as an option in their LibApps menu upon login.  

### System Settings

The most useful sections of System Settings control the Look & Feel of our site, as well as the header and custom CSS/JS sections. 

1. In the ```Admin``` drop-down, choose ```System Settings.``` In the General tab, you will find our syste, name as well as the Admin Email, which we've set to lsupport@princeton.edu. That can be changed in this section if needed. 
2. In the ```Look & Feel``` tab, you can customize fonts and colors for our site. 
3. In the ```Page Header``` tab, we use the ```Display this HTML``` option and use the [Lux Design System repo](https://github.com/pulibrary/lux-design-system). You can work with the DACS team to edit or update the Guide header/footer using Lux.
4. In the ```Custom CSS/JS``` we also use the [Lux Design System](https://github.com/pulibrary/lux-design-system) to paste code as well as link external CSS files. Again, you can work with the DACS team to edit or update this code. 

### Question Bank

When users add questions to forms, surveys, quizzes, and tutorials, they must add their questions to the central Question Bank so that they are reusable in other parts of LibWizard. The Question Bank can be managed from the Admin panel. 

1. In the ```Admin``` drop-down, choose ```Question Bank.```
2. Use the blue ```Add Question to Bank``` button to add a new question. 
3. In the main portion of the page, you will see all the questions in the bank. To modify one, click on the three dots in the ```Actions``` column on the right. Here, you can either preview how the question looks or edit the question.
