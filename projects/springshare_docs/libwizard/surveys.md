To create/manage surveys:

2. From the main dashboard, you can click to view a survey's URL/Code, # of Submissions, # Items in the form, and you can preview a surey by clicking the three dots in the ```Actions``` column on the right. 
3. Surveys can be organized into folders by clicking the blue ```+Create New Folder``` button at the top. 
4. Click the blue ```+Create New``` at the top to create a new survey. You can start with a blank slate or by copying an existing survey. You can also give your survey a friendly URL and description. 
5. To edit an existing survey, click on it's title in the ```Name``` column on the left.
