## Tutorials & Assessments

Tutorials in LibWizard allow users to create content-rich interactive in-frame assessment modules. They can be embedded into websites and other media, including LibGuides and Canvas, for interactive experiences, and they allow for instant feedback on answers. 

### Types of Tutorials 

There are three types of Tutorials (read more in Springshare's [documentation](https://ask.springshare.com/libwizard/faq/353)): 
1. Standalone: intended to be viewed via their own direct URL
2. Tutorial embedded in a webpage: intended to be displayed on top of an existing website
3. Interactive: intended to be viewed via its own direct URL and allow users to interact with the information being shown to them
