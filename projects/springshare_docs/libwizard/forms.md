## Forms

Forms in LibWizard can be embedded in other parts of the LibApps system as well as on webpages via <iframe> codes. 

1. In LibWizard, open the ```Forms``` tab in the top navigation. 
2. From the main dashboard, you can click to view a form's URL/Code, # of Submissions, # Items in the form, and you can preview a form or move it to a folder by clicking the three dots in the ```Actions``` column on the right. 
3. Forms can be organized into folders by clicking the blue ```+Create New Folder``` button at the top. 
4. Click the blue ```+Create New``` at the top to create a new form. You can start with a blank slate or by copying an existing form. You can also give your form a friendly URL and description. 
5. To edit an existing form, click on it's title in the ```Name``` column on the left.
6. Springshare has much documentation about adding questions to form, managing its settings, reporting, permissions and sharing. See the forms [documentation](https://ask.springshare.com/libwizard/search/?t=0&adv=1&topics=Forms) to learn more (note: you must be signed into your Springshare account to access their help documents).
